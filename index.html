        <p>
            I love programming and software engineering in general.
            I have significant professional experience programming in C++ and other languages,
            I like working with low level features and metaprogramming,           but I also enjoy learning and applying language-independent concepts and patterns to my work. I can do my job with minima maximal independence,
            but I don't really like the lone rider programmer clich&egrave: great software is only built by teams of people!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have significant experience with several "tools of the trade", from UML to version control.
            I know how to manage complex branching models with GIT and how to set continuous integration
            support using different tools. I am much into SLDC, and I have special interest for the TDD and
            BDD cycle, which I have explored with tools like Cucumber, RSpec, QTest or GoogleMock.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the joy of learning new languages and technologies, I have been playing with
            Ruby (and the Rails framework) for a while now, and I know how to create and deploy set simple
            full-stack web applications based on these.
