<p>
    I love programming and software engineering in general.
    I have significant professional experience programming in C++ and other languages.
    I like working with low level features and metaprogramming, but I also enjoy learning and applying
    language-independent concepts and patterns to my work. I can do my job with minimal input and maximal independence,
    but I don't really like the lone rider programmer clich&egrave: great software is only built by teams of people!

<h2>Experience in Computer Vision</h2>
<p>
    During my first two years working at <h>GRADIANT</h>, I learned about <b>facial feature tracking</b>. We implemented
    our own version of a Mean-Shift based Constrained Local Model (in the fashion of <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=6417">[Saragih2009]</a>), as well as other
    types of CLM and AAM -based systems. My <a href="/download/TFM_JavierSanchezRois.pdf">master thesis</a> summarises most of this work in face tracking and its
    application to expression recognition and pose detection.
</p>
<p>
    Later on, I have worked in video and scene analysis projects where I had the opportunity of learning about
    object detection and tracking. We have explored the possibilities of bayesian filtering for tracking in
    videosurveillance environments in projects like
    <a href="http://www.gradiant.org/es/lineas-de-investigacion/proyectos/664-a2vises-aplicaciones-de-analisis-avanzado-de-video-para-una-smart-city-eficiente-y-segura.html">a2vises</a>
    and <a href="http://www.gradiant.org/lineas-de-investigacion/proyectos/770-videoguard.html">videoguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I have also participated in two European Projects (<a href="http://maven-project.eu/">MAVEN</a> and
    <a href="http://www.gradiant.org/en/research-lines/proyectos/822-caesaris.html">CAESARIS</a>),
    where we have developed different systems for industrial partners. Some of the implemented modules in these
    projects included text detection and terrain segmentation using state-of-the-art algorithms.
