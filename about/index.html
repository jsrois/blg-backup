<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    I love programming and software engineering in general.
    I have significant professional experience programming in C++ and other languages.
    I like working with low level features and metaprogramming, but I also enjoy learning and applying
    language-independent concepts and patterns to my work. I can do my job with minimal input and maximal independence,
    but I don't really like the lone rider programmer clich&egrave: great software is only built by teams of people!

<h2>Computer Vision</h2>
<p>
    During my first two years working at <h>GRADIANT</h>, they taught me a lot about <b>facial feature tracking</b>. We implemented
    our own version of a Mean-Shift based Constrained Local Model (CLM; in the fashion of <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=6417">[Saragih2009]</a>, as well as other
    types of CLM and AAM -based systems. My Master's Thesis (2013) summarises most of work in face tracking and expression
    recognition.

<p>
    Later on, I have worked in video and scene analysis projects
</p>




<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
    I am also used to the "tools of the trade", from UML to version control.
    I know how to manage complex branching models with <b>git</b> and how to set continuous integration
    support using different tools. I am much into the Software Development Life Cycle, and I have special
    interest for the TDD and BDD cycle, which I have explored with tools like <b>cucumber</b>,
    RSpec, QTest or GoogleMock.
</p>
<p>
    For the joy of learning new languages and technologies, I have been playing with
    Ruby (and the Rails framework) for a while now, and I know how to create and deploy set simple
    full-stack web applications based on these.
